# Tugas 1 IF4073 2022
This repository is used for first project of IF4073 - Image Processing and Interpretation.

## What is this project about?
We implement many operations to enhance the image, such as intensity histogram, contrast enhancement, histogram equalization and histogram specification. We also make GUI for those operations, so it can load image that you desire. This project is implemented using MATLAB without using these functions: ```imhist()```, ```hist()``` and ```histeq()```.

## How to run the GUI?
1. Make sure you've installed MATLAB on your device.
2. Go to ```src/``` folder.
3. Double-click ```app.mlapp```.
4. A window will be opened and the GUI is being run and every tab is already initiated with images.
5. Sample images for every task can be found in the 'images' folder.
